        First off, elephants are just darn cute with those big ears of those. They are great parents, all about the group and caring for each other.

        Second, elephants represent spiritual value in many cultures. For example, my spiritual relationship to the elephant represents maternity, motherhood and family.

        I intend to have a fully built out elephant in mosaic form tattooed on my upper left arm by next year.
